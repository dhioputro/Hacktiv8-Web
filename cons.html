                        Most people say that Komodo is in the edge of extinction. For some reasons, that opinion could be true. But in fact, it does not applied in the global condition where the dragons are distributed in islands with different conditions. The threats of their population in the National Park is different with their population in Flores Island. The island population within Komodo National Park will be different if compared one to another, depends on the size of the island. The Komodo population will be also different from 1970, when Walter Auffenberg researched 11 years before the Komodo National Park was established. Today, we have more comprehensive and accurate information about the dragon based on our research started in 1990s by Claudio Ciofi, continued by Tim S. Jessop in 2002, in collaboration with Indonesian government and finished in 2007. After that, their program was continued by Komodo Survival Program (KSP) until now. KSP was formed by Indonesian researchers that formerly work with Tim Jessop, and now Claudio Ciofi as well as Tim Jessop are continuing their roles as their scientific advisors.

                        Based on updated information of Komodo population, the conservation status of Komodo in IUCN redlist book version 2013.2 is vulnerable to extinction. Since 1990s, Indonesian authorities has established a protection status for the dragon through National Decree (UU) no. 5 tahun 1990 and Peraturan Pemerintah no 7 tahun 1999. In the international wildlife trade, Komodo is listed to Appendix I CITES, which means the commercial trading of live speciments or any parts, dead or alive of Komodo is prohibited. 

                        Komodo is also a National pride and National animal of Indonesia, through the Decree Keppres no 4 tahun 1992. It makes Komodo as a flagship species and gives a positive impact on Komodo international trading that requires permit from the President of Indonesia.</p>

                        Priority and threats of Komodo population is different based on the each island's condition. It is differed by the administrative area of Komodo National Park and Flores Island. The Komodo National Park has established for 30 years, protecting the dragons from several threats, specifically on threats caused by human activity (anthropogenic). However, the population in the small islands are also important such as Nusa Kode and Gili Motang island. Their small size of population, less prey (deer) and higher inbreeding factors lead them to be on the brink. We have to learn from Padar Island case, where once deer were overhunted and followed by the extinction of its Komodo's population.

                        In the other side, the population threats of Komodo in Flores Island happened due to human acctivities. First factor is the overhunting of deer, slash-and-burn agricultural method, and high competition with feral dogs which were introduced by human. These factors lead a decrease and cornered Komodo population, and impact on livestock depredation and conflict with human is unavoidable.</p>
